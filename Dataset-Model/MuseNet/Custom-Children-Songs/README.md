Multi-instrumental model with drums

***

This is a full encoding model with velocities and MIDI channels

***

MuseNet encoding + perfect timings + transform(60) + Custom Children Songs MIDI dataset (~146 compositions)

***

512 attn x 512 embed x 8 heads x 6 layers

Trained to Floss 0.08 @ 6e-4 lr for 2 epochs (24hrs on Quadro P6000 GPU)

***

PLEASE NOTE that due to the complexity of the multi-instrumental music results may not be as impressive as with single-instrument models.
