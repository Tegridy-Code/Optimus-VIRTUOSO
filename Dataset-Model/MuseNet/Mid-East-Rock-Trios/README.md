Multi-instrumental model with drums

PLEASE NOTE: This is primarily composition/continuation model so it may not play well by itself.

***

This is a full encoding model with velocities and MIDI channels

***

MuseNet encoding + perfect timings + Mid-East Rock Trios MIDI Dataset (~587 compositions)

***

512 attn x 512 embed x 8 heads x 6 layers

Trained to Floss 0.26 @ 6e-4 lr for 2 epochs (48hrs on Tesla V100 GPU)

***

PLEASE NOTE that due to the complexity of the multi-instrumental music results may not be as impressive as with single-instrument models.
